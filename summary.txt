Graph Choices and Findings Summary

This analysis focuses on three key aspects of stock market data to help in predicting price movements for selected stocks (GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN).

1. **Closing Price Over Time:**
   - **Choice:** This is the most fundamental time-series graph. It shows the historical trend of a stock's price, helping to identify long-term upward or downward trends, as well as periods of volatility and stability.
   - **Findings:** For all analyzed stocks, the long-term trend has been overwhelmingly positive, showing significant growth over the years. This graph is essential for understanding the overall historical performance and trajectory.

2. **Closing Price with 20-Day and 50-Day Moving Averages:**
   - **Choice:** Moving averages smooth out short-term price fluctuations and help to identify the direction of the current trend. The crossover of a shorter-term moving average (MA20) above a longer-term one (MA50) is often interpreted as a bullish signal (a "golden cross"), while the opposite is a bearish signal (a "death cross"). These are common indicators used in technical analysis for prediction.
   - **Findings:** The moving average graphs for all three stocks show multiple crossovers. For instance, a golden cross can be observed preceding significant upward price movements, while death crosses often appear before price corrections. This suggests that moving average crossover strategies could be a viable component of a predictive model for these stocks.

3. **Trading Volume Over Time:**
   - **Choice:** Volume is a crucial indicator of the market's conviction behind a price move. A price increase on high volume is generally seen as a stronger, more sustainable trend than an increase on low volume. Spikes in volume can often precede or confirm a significant price change or trend reversal.
   - **Findings:** The volume charts show significant spikes during periods of high price volatility and around major company announcements or earnings reports. For example, a sharp price drop accompanied by high volume indicates strong selling pressure. This confirms that volume is a key feature to consider when predicting the strength and likelihood of future price movements.
